🧮 Mathematical Sequence Analysis

📊 This project is a Python application that analyses and visualises mathematical sequences.

🚀 Features

✅ Constructs Fibonacci, square, triangle and prime number sequences.

✅ Makes statistical analysis of sequences (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).

✅ Calculate the differences of sequences and visualise their distributions.

✅ Creates intuitive graphics with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
